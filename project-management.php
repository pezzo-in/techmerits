        <p>
            The core elements of our technology project management services are:
        </p>

        <h2>Agile Project Management</h2>

        <p>
            Being a value-driven methodology, agile project management enables organizations to deliver high quality
            results. While managing your unique project, we consider your business operations, requirements, priorities,
            and beyond. Our project managers work closely with our clients to track the project&#39;s progress, issues, and
            results.
        </p>

        <p>
            While using the agile management approach, we divide responsibility among different team members. And this
            is how we combine individual efforts to get you what you expect from our side-successful technology
            solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>Waterfall Project Management </h2>

        <p>
            Since waterfall approach is a sequential design procedure, each of its stages has to be completed in order.
            This methodology doesn&#39;t allow errors or mistakes, so developers have to work carefully while preparing a
            plan. This is where the dedicated, expert managers, developers, and analysts of Techmerits prove their
            value.
        </p>

        <p>
            From specifying project requirements to implementing different units and from integrating multiple units
            into a single system to testing the entire design, every step has to be executed professionally, efficiently
            to avoid costly errors. Techmerits employs specialized project managers who excel in waterfall model
            development and application.
