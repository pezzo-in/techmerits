      <h2 id="waterfall">Waterfall Project Management </h2>

      <p>
        Since waterfall approach is a sequential design procedure, each of its stages has to be completed in order.
        This methodology doesn&#39;t allow errors or mistakes, so developers have to work carefully while preparing a
        plan. This is where the dedicated, expert managers, developers, and analysts of Techmerits prove their
        value.
    </p>

    <p>
        From specifying project requirements to implementing different units and from integrating multiple units
        into a single system to testing the entire design, every step has to be executed professionally, efficiently
        to avoid costly errors. Techmerits employs specialized project managers who excel in waterfall model
        development and application.
