            <h2>Privacy Statement</h2><strong>Privacy Statement for www.Techmerits.com</strong>

            <p>Techmerits Software Solutions has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm's
                commitment to privacy and to ensure our users that Techmerits uses all reasonable efforts to help
                protect their sensitive and private information from unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration and
                destruction. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for
                www.Techmerits.com</p>

            <p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and/or to administer our Web site. This
                gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything
                personally identifiable. This means that a user?s session will be tracked, but the user will be
                anonymous.</p>

            <p>When requesting more information, our site's registration form requires you to give us contact
                information like your name and email address. We use this contact information from the registration form
                to send you information about our company.</p>

            <p>Techmerits Software Solutions is the sole owner of the information collected on www.Techmerits.com.
                Techmerits collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on
                our Web site.
            </p>
            <strong>Security</strong>

            <p>Techmerits uses reasonable efforts to treat all consumer information, not just the sensitive and private
                information mentioned above, in a confidential manner. Only employees who need the information as part
                of their day to day responsibilities are granted access to personally identifiable information. This
                site has security measures in place designed to protect the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of
                information under our control. The data resides behind a firewall, with access restricted to authorized
                personnel only.</p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong>

            <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 12, 2014. Please check our Privacy Policy periodically as
                Techmerits reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Changes to Techmerit?s Privacy Policy
                will be posted to this Site. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by
                email, or by means of a notice on our homepage. If, however, we are going to use users' personally
                identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify
                users by e-mail or by posting a prominent notice on our Site 30 days prior to implementing the
                change.</p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>

            <p>Though we make every reasonable commercial effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose
                personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is
                necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web
                site.</p>

            <p>This policy and the statements outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or
                other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p><strong>Trademarks</strong>
